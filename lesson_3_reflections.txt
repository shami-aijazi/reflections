-When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to work on a project from multiple devices, when you want to collaborate with others on a project, 
or when you want to display your project to the public.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather havaing Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There may be changes that you are not ready to make public just yet.
