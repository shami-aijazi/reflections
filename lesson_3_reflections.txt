-When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to work on a project from multiple devices, when you want to collaborate with others on a project, 
or when you want to display your project to the public.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather havaing Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There may be changes that you are not ready to make public just yet.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clone: Making a duplicate of an existing repo, either from local to local, or GitHub to local.
Fork: Making a duplicate of an existing repo on GitHub, to another repo on GitHub. Also give credit to original author.
Branch: Creatign a tangent offshoot from your main master branch so you can do stuff on it while maintaining your master branch as is.

-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can work on it if you are offline.

-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
One way would be to send files over email. That would be much harder and consume much more time than doing it on GitHub.
