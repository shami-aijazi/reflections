-What happens when you intialize a repository? Why do you need to do that?
A .git file gets created that stores metadata about the repository. This allows you to do git things on the 
repo, like see logs, diffs, and commits.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think 
it offers?
The staging area is where you can add, view, and edit the files from your working directory before committing 
them to the repository.
